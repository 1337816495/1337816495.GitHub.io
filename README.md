<p align="center"><samp>The first version of my blog was made with a JavaScript-based Markdown parser and CSS. The second version added some modern tools on top of that, such as Solid.js, TypeScript, and a set of scaffolding tools. I am now starting to work on the third version using Astro. I will not be publishing new blog posts until then, but I will continue writing.</samp></p>
