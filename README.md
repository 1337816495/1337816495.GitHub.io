### I say
This is the scaffolding I customized for myself, which is used to translate markdown into html, and can also show other demos on the cover.
Lately, I've been optimizing old notes and writing new ones.
I will upload the demo after about two months, there are some planned demos that have not yet started (for web3d and webxr).

<br/>

### Usage
Execute the following commands in order to deploy new notes. After I made some optimizations to this process, I combined the 4 commands into one.
1. `npm run create-article`
2. `npm run create-catalogue`
3. `npm run create-font`
4. `npm run deploy`
